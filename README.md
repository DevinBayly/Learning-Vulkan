## About the Book
Vulkan, the next generation graphics and compute API, is the latest offering by Khronos. This API is the successor of OpenGL and in contrast offers greatflexibility and high performance capabilities to control modern GPU devices. With this book, you'll get great insights into the working of Vulkan and how you can make stunning graphics run with minimum hardware requirements.
##Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. Each folder starts with a number followed by the application name. For example, Chapter02.



The code will look like the following:
```
foreach layerProperty{
VkExtensionProperties *instanceExtensions;
res = vkEnumerateInstanceExtensionProperties(layer_name,
&instanceExtensionCount, instanceExtensions);
}
```

Please follow through the hardware and software requirements provided with this book. The reader must have a decent knowledge of C/C++ programming. Coding experience is required.
